Setup blog with Github page and Jekyll.
The offical docs from Github Page are all we needs. Just a little things here and there to get this website up.
Outline of all the steps:

1. Register the domain with Namecheap since it free and it has email forwarder
2. Create Github account & a public repo
3. Setup Githup page setting & custom domain name
4. Install Jekyll on local machine
5. Test post at local machine
6. Commit to Github 

That's it. Now is time to build up a habit of writing daily.

[Jekyll Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

Some ideas todo:
1. Powershell task to create a file in draft folder daily with layout and title
2. Writing during the day
3. commit the next day
